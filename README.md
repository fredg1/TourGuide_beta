## TourGuide beta/WIP repository

A place where you can help beta-test (or get early access to) unofficially released changes.

Simply checkout the [appropriate branch](https://github.com/fredg1/TourGuide_beta/branches) in mafia's GCLI (master will only ever contain this README):

`svn checkout https://github.com/fredg1/TourGuide_beta/branches/ <branch_name> /`

Add comments, problems, recommendations and questions under [Issues](https://github.com/fredg1/TourGuide_beta/issues).


#### Additional info
Don't delete your original copy of TourGuide! Especially the file `relay_TourGuide.js`: I'm assuming you already have it since you most likely also have TourGuide, so I didn't duplicate it.

Be sure to clean your svn and relay folders when you're done testing/using a copy; they won't go by themselves...
