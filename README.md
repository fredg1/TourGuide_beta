## TourGuide beta/WIP repository

A place where you can help beta-test (or get early access to) unofficially released changes.

Simply checkout the [appropriate branch](https://github.com/fredg1/TourGuide_beta/branches) in mafia's GCLI (master will only ever contain this README):

`svn checkout https://github.com/fredg1/TourGuide_beta/branches/ <branch_name> /`

Add feedback (comments/problems/recommendations/questions) under [Issues](https://github.com/fredg1/TourGuide_beta/issues), or send a PM on Discord or KoL.
Sending feedback is encouraged.


#### Additional info
Don't delete your original copy of TourGuide! Especially the file `relay_TourGuide.js`: I'm assuming you already have it since you most likely also have TourGuide, so I didn't duplicate it.

Be sure to clean your svn and relay folders when you're done testing/using a copy; they won't go by themselves...


Also, sadly, this obviously won't include any change you made to your own copy of Guide/TourGuide...

### Branches

minimize:
  - adds the ability to reduce the size of any tile, removing the non-title text.
  - Merged with [snapper](https://github.com/cdrock/TourGuide/pull/48), so you'll still be able to test that... RIIIIIGHT? <_<
  - Also, since I had to go through the entirety of Guide to ID everything, also did a few additional things that, for my own sake, I will not list here.
